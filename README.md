# NAVAJO_CARS
This is a C++ project to distribute 80 people on a mission trip into different cars multiple times minimizing repeated pairs.

It uses a graph represented as an adjacency list to store the history of who has been with each other, which can be manipulated to favor/prevent certain pairs from forming. When forming new car assignments, the program looks at the 2D array to decide who to put in cars.
